# ProPreSlides
Propresenter lacks some features that I think would be very useful. The way this will interact with propresenter is either by exported bundle or the default propresenter file storage location /documents/propresenter.

## Goals
- Spell checker
- Cleaning bible verse slides (spaces after periods, removeing pipe (|) character)
- Image management (remove images that are no longer being used)
- Presentation statistics (file sizes, number of presentations, )
- Templated songs (have a main song that will be ripple edit only text)
