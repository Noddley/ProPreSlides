Spell Checker from Stack overflow

from spellchecker import SpellChecker

spell = SpellChecker()

# find those words that may be misspelled
misspelled = spell.unknown(['something', 'is', 'hapenning', 'here'])
#misspelled is a list of misspelled words? test this




Plan

right click export as bundle
unzip bundle
read .pro files (encoded with google protobuf)
find the rtf_data field for the text boxes and get other useful stuff (make a general analyzer?)
strip rtf or convert
run a spell checker and present possible misspellings(run some tests on files to see how reliable it is, if it is make a auto run feature)
add feature to auto strip dumb things like | characters from bible verses and add spaces after all periods and commas
